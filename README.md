# THP W7D3..5 - EventHack v.20 - Cracking global event organization (again...)

## Content

Here below are some of the stuff you may want to cover while browsing this Ruby on Rail (RoR) project :

* Migrations, schema, data models, seeds and more - See _/db/_

* Corresponding models and relations - See _/app/models/_ and the data model pictured below mixing MCD, MLD and MPD

* Configuration (incl. 'routes.rb', 'database.yml' initialized for PostegreSQL...) - See related files in the _/config/_ directory

* Controllers - See _/app/controllers/_

* Views and layouts - See _/app/views/_ sub-directories. In particular, _/app/views/layouts/_ gathers the header / footer templating and _/devise/_ stores all 'devise' gem related pages and helpers

Enjoy, _wanderer_ :wink: !
